# War-card-game
Card game called war, played between two computers. A deck of 52 cards is equally split between two players.  The two players draw a card each and compare with each other. If a player draws a card with a higher value than the other player, the player with the higher value card wins. If a player wins the round, the player takes both their card and their own card to their own deck. If both players draw the card with the same value, then war begins and each player add 5 cards from their deck to their cards. They then compare draw from their hand and compare. If one player wins, they get all the cards on the table.
